## What is AURORA?
**AURORA** is the front-end of a clinical support system that classifies depressive disorders using machine learning. ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This application serves as the interface where psychologists or mental health professionals can:

- Input patient data for analysis
- Visualize ML-based diagnostic suggestions
- Interpret results with UI aids and user-friendly reports

Aurora aims to bridge the gap between psychological evaluation and machine learning models through a simple, accessible, and professional interface.

This front-end is fully modular and built with modern tooling for speed, maintainability, and scalability.

## What I Have Done Here

### ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

- **Component-based architecture**: Built reusable UI components for forms, result views, and layout templates.
- **React Hooks**: Managed state and side effects efficiently using `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks.
- **Type safety with TypeScript**: Ensured type checking for form inputs, API responses, and props, increasing robustness and developer experience.
- **Form validation**: Integrated client-side validation for patient input using libraries and custom logic.
- **Basic API integration**: Connected the interface with the backend ML endpoints for real-time inference.
